# Building in Public: Our Journey to Beta Launch

Building Mark has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my career. And I'm doing it completely in public.

## Why Build in Public?

**Transparency breeds trust.** 

In a world where every company claims to be "AI-powered" and "revolutionary," I wanted to show the actual work—the code, the decisions, the pivots, and yes, the mistakes.

Building in public means:

- Sharing our roadmap openly
- Documenting technical decisions and why we made them
- Being honest about what's working and what isn't
- Letting our community shape the product

## The Tech Stack

We're building Mark with:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4, custom context management system
- **Auth**: Clerk for seamless authentication

Why this stack? Speed and reliability. We needed to move fast without sacrificing user experience.

## Current Progress

**Where we are today:**

✅ Brand Profile system (capture your brand DNA)  
✅ Threads interface (AI conversations that remember everything)  
✅ Idea Lab (3-phase brainstorming framework)  
✅ Projects workspace (organize campaigns and content)  
✅ Daily News (personalized industry insights)  
🚧 Knowledge Base (in development)  
🚧 Task management (coming soon)  
🚧 Analytics dashboard (on the roadmap)

## The Challenges

**1. Context Window Management**

The hardest technical problem we've solved is maintaining brand context across conversations without hitting token limits. Our solution? A custom context compression system that keeps your brand memory accessible while optimizing for AI performance.

**2. Balancing Power and Simplicity**

Mark needs to be powerful enough for agencies but simple enough for solo creators. That's a tough balance. We're solving it with progressive disclosure—simple by default, powerful when you need it.

**3. Building What Users Actually Need**

This is why building in public matters. Every week, I talk to users. Their feedback directly shapes what we build next.

## What's Coming

Between now and our **January 22, 2026 beta launch**, we're focused on:

- Refining the core features based on alpha feedback
- Building the Knowledge Base for storing research and insights
- Adding collaboration features for teams
- Performance optimization and polish

## Join the Journey

We're looking for more alpha testers who want to shape Mark's future. If you're a marketer or creator who's tired of fragmented tools and wants to influence what we build, [join our waitlist](https://usemark.app).

Building in public isn't just a marketing strategy—it's a commitment to transparency and community. Let's build the future of marketing together.
